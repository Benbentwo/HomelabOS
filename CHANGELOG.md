## Services Removed

- Removed mailserver. It's no longer maintained.

## Release Notes

When upgrading to v0.7 you must run `make restart` for your services to show back up afterwards.

You will also be asked for your sudo password and preferred default_password again, due to the upgrade.

If you are currently using a bastion host via Tinc, when upgrading to 0.7, set `bastion.reset_iptables` to True. This will blow away any and all iptables rules so use this option with care.

The default storage location has been moved from `/mnt/homelabos/media` to `/mnt/nas`. Both the storage location and the HomelabOS installation directories are now configurable with `storage_dir` and `volumes_root`.

The `TV`, `Movies`, and `Comics` folders have moved to living inside `Video`. The new default location for TV for example would be `/mnt/nas/Video/TV`.
